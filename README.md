# MiniHUD

An X-Plane plugin that shows a small instrument panel for flying
without seeing the cockpit.

Sometimes I like to fly from the external view, or on a small laptop
screen where the cockpit instruments are very hard to read. I created
the MiniHUD to make X-Plane usable in these situations.

From left to right, the plugin shows:

1. An airspeed indicator with the usual V-speed zones
2. a trim/control indicator of aileron/elevator/rudder trims as white
   bars, and current control input as thicker white lines (useful if
   you move your rudder with buttons instead of pedals)
3. engine indicators for Throttle, Prop, and Mixture (drag to change)
4. a flaps indicator (drag to change)
5. an altitude indicator and vertical speed gauge
6. a compass, with a wind speed/direction barb

The UI is meant to be minimal, so as to get out of your way while
flying. The functionality is somewhat similar to "Scenic Flyer", but
works on Mac and Linux. In design, it is somewhat similar to Microsoft
Flight Simulator 2020's instrument overlay.

### Configuration

You can drag and drop the MiniHUD to a different place on the screen, 
and you can resize it by dragging on one of its corners.

Bind a button to miniHUD → show/hide miniHUD to switch the HUD on or
off.

### Installation

Unzip the MiniHUD directory to X-Plane/Resources/Plugins. Your X-Plane
directory should now contain

<pre>
📂 X-Plane 12
└ 📂 Resources
  └ 📂 plugins
    └ 📂 MiniHUD
      ├ 📁 64
      ├ 📁 data
      ├ 📁 liblinux
      └ 📄 README.md</pre>

### Compatibility

MiniHUD works in X-Plane 11 and 12, on Windows, macOS (Intel+ARM), and Linux.

### Changelog
